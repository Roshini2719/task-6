Step 1: Understand Password Strength
Before creating passwords, understand what makes a password strong:

Length: Longer passwords are stronger.

Complexity: Mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols.

Unpredictability: Avoid dictionary words, patterns (like "123456"), or personal info.

No reuse: Don't use the same password across multiple accounts.

Step-2: Create Multiple Passwords

Step 3: Test Passwords with Online Tools
Use a site like https://passwordmeter.com 

For each password:

Enter it in the tool.

Record the score, estimated time to crack, and feedback (e.g., “too short,” “dictionary word used”).

Step 4: Record Results in a Table

Step 5: Analyze and Identify Best Practices
Based on results, list what makes a password strong:

✅ Use 12+ characters
✅ Mix uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols
✅ Avoid dictionary words or common substitutions (like "0" for "o")
✅ Avoid personal info or keyboard patterns
✅ Use random strings or a password manager

Step 6: Research Common Password Attacks
Briefly explain these:

Brute Force: Tries all combinations. Longer, complex passwords resist this better.

Dictionary Attack: Uses common words. Avoiding dictionary words reduces risk.

Credential Stuffing: Uses leaked passwords. Don't reuse passwords.

Phishing: Not related to strength but gaining the password via trickery.

Step 7: Summarize How Complexity Affects Security
Longer, complex passwords exponentially increase cracking time.

A 6-character simple password can be cracked in seconds.

A 12-character random password can take millions of years.

Simple substitutions (like “P@ssw0rd”) are still predictable and weak.
